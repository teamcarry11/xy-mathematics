# Agent Work Allocation & Coordination

**Date**: 2025-11-21 15:52:00 PST  
**Purpose**: Clear work allocation to prevent overlaps and maximize parallel productivity

## Current Status: ✅ **NO URGENT CHECK-IN NEEDED**

### Phase 3: Dream Browser Core - 100% COMPLETE ✅
- All sub-phases complete
- No blocking issues
- Git history shows clean implementations
- Ready to proceed

## Do We Need to Check In?

### ✅ **Not Urgently**

**Reasons**:
1. **Phase 3 Complete**: All work is done, no conflicts
2. **Git History Clean**: My implementations are current, no merge issues
3. **Clear Boundaries**: Can establish clear work allocation for Phase 4
4. **Non-Blocking**: Other agent can work on their domain independently

### ⚠️ **But Should Coordinate Before Phase 4**

**Why**:
- Phase 4 (Integration) has potential overlaps
- Multi-pane layout could be worked on by both
- Live preview involves both editor and browser
- VCS integration could overlap

**Recommendation**: Establish clear boundaries now, then proceed independently

## What Should the Other Agent Do?

### Option 1: Continue VM/Kernel Work (Recommended) ✅

**Their Domain** (No Overlaps):
- **Kernel Features**: Memory management, process scheduling, device drivers
- **VM Enhancements**: JIT optimizations, performance improvements
- **Platform Work**: RISC-V platform implementation, macOS Tahoe integration
- **Documentation**: Kernel API docs, VM usage guides

**Benefits**:
- ✅ No conflicts with my work
- ✅ Parallel development possible
- ✅ Critical infrastructure work
- ✅ Their expertise area

### Option 2: Browser-Side Integration Features

**Clear Boundaries**:
- **Other Agent**: Browser rendering optimizations, browser-side VCS status
- **This Agent**: Editor-side features, editor VCS integration, Tree-sitter, LSP

**Potential Overlaps** (Need Coordination):
- Multi-pane layout (both might work on)
- Live preview sync (both might work on)

**Recommendation**: Coordinate before starting these

### Option 3: Documentation & Testing

**Safe Work** (No Conflicts):
- Comprehensive test suites
- API documentation
- Usage examples
- Performance benchmarks

**Benefits**:
- ✅ No code conflicts
- ✅ Valuable work
- ✅ Can be done in parallel

### Option 4: Take a Break / Other Priorities

**If Nothing Urgent**:
- Other agent can focus on other priorities
- No blocking dependencies
- Can return when Phase 4 coordination is needed

## Recommended Work Allocation for Phase 4

### Dream Editor/Browser Agent (This Agent)
**Focus**: Editor-side integration
- ✅ Multi-pane layout (editor panes, editor tabs)
- ✅ Live preview (editor → browser sync)
- ✅ Tree-sitter integration
- ✅ LSP enhancements
- ✅ Editor VCS integration (Magit-style for editor)

**Files I'll Work On**:
- `src/aurora_layout.zig` (multi-pane)
- `src/aurora_tree_sitter.zig` (Tree-sitter)
- `src/aurora_lsp.zig` (LSP)
- `src/aurora_vcs.zig` (editor VCS)

### VM/Kernel/Browser Agent (Other Agent)
**Focus**: Browser-side and kernel integration
- ✅ Browser rendering optimizations
- ✅ Browser-side VCS status display
- ✅ Kernel integration for browser
- ✅ VM performance for browser workloads
- ✅ Platform-specific browser features

**Files They Can Work On**:
- `src/dream_browser_*.zig` (browser optimizations)
- `src/kernel/` (kernel features)
- `src/kernel_vm/` (VM enhancements)
- `src/platform/` (platform work)

### Shared Work (Need Coordination)
**Before Starting**:
- Multi-pane layout (if both work on UI)
- Live preview sync (if both work on sync)
- VCS integration (if both work on git/jj)

**Coordination Process**:
1. Check in with user before starting
2. Establish clear ownership
3. Define interfaces between components
4. Work in parallel on separate parts

## Immediate Recommendations

### For Other Agent: ✅ **Continue VM/Kernel Work**

**Best Options** (No Conflicts):
1. **Kernel Features**: Memory management, process scheduling
2. **VM Enhancements**: JIT optimizations, performance
3. **Platform Work**: RISC-V platform, macOS Tahoe
4. **Documentation**: Kernel/VM API docs, examples

**Why This Works**:
- ✅ Their expertise area
- ✅ No overlaps with my work
- ✅ Critical infrastructure
- ✅ Can work independently

### For This Agent: ✅ **Proceed with Phase 4 Editor Features**

**I'll Work On**:
- Tree-sitter integration
- LSP enhancements
- Editor VCS integration
- Editor-side multi-pane layout

**Why This Works**:
- ✅ Editor-focused (my domain)
- ✅ No conflicts with kernel/VM work
- ✅ Can work in parallel
- ✅ Clear boundaries

## When to Check In

### ✅ **Not Needed Now**
- Phase 3 is complete
- No blocking issues
- Clear work allocation possible

### ⚠️ **Check In Before**:
1. **Starting Phase 4 Shared Features**:
   - Multi-pane layout (if other agent wants to work on browser panes)
   - Live preview (if other agent wants to work on browser sync)
   - VCS integration (if other agent wants to work on VCS)

2. **If Overlap Detected**:
   - File already exists
   - Phase marked "IN PROGRESS" by other agent
   - Unclear ownership

3. **After Completing Major Features**:
   - Update coordination documents
   - Note any potential overlaps
   - Document interfaces for shared components

## Summary

### Do We Need to Check In?
**Answer**: ✅ **Not urgently, but should coordinate before Phase 4 shared features**

### What Should Other Agent Do?
**Answer**: ✅ **Continue VM/Kernel work (their domain, no conflicts)**

**Recommended Work**:
1. Kernel features (memory, processes, devices)
2. VM enhancements (JIT, performance)
3. Platform work (RISC-V, macOS Tahoe)
4. Documentation (API docs, examples)

**Alternative**: Take a break / focus on other priorities until Phase 4 coordination

### What Will This Agent Do?
**Answer**: ✅ **Proceed with Phase 4 editor features**

**My Work**:
1. Tree-sitter integration
2. LSP enhancements
3. Editor VCS integration
4. Editor-side multi-pane layout

**Coordination**: Will check in before starting shared Phase 4 features
