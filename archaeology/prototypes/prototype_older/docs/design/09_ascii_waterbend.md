# Grain Documentary Part 9 — ASCII Waterbending

Waterbending art reflects resilience. This library offers flowing shapes
for documentation, Nostr announcements, and settlement dashboards. Every
pattern obeys the 73-column rule and evokes Helen Atthowe’s ecological
teachings.

Usage notes:
- Insert water motifs before critical alerts to remind teams to stay
  flexible.
- Combine with Lagoons of tests: run `zig build test` before sharing art.
