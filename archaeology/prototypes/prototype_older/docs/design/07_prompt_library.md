# Grain Documentary Part 7 — Prompt Library

Prompts are the lifeblood of Grain. This episode curates patterns from
`docs/prompts.md` and shows how we keep the ledger descending via the new
unit test. We categorize prompts into setup, build, test, document, and
artistic requests. Cursor operators learn to append responsibly, rerun
`wrap-docs`, and mirror summaries to `docs/outputs.md` for accountability.
