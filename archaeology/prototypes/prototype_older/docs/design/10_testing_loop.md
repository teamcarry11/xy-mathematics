# Grain Documentary Part 10 — Testing & Matklad Loop

Testing keeps Grain honest. We narrate how `zig build test` spans Ray,
Nostr, Contracts, CDN, Grain Lattice, and the prompts ledger. The
Matklad principles—fast, data-driven, resilient—guide our experiments in
`tests-experiments/000.md` and `001.md`. Operators learn to append fuzz
logs, interpret failures (like the prompt order check), and fix them
within the same session.
