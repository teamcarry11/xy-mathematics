# Grain Documentary Part 1 — Arrival At Tahoe

Grain begins as a twilight terminal where Zig, Cursor, and Nostr share a
single pane. This introduction sketches the vision: a TigerStyle kernel,
a TigerBank settlement core, and a vegan-futurist social terminal weaved
together. Readers meet Glow G2, the calm Aquarian guide, and learn why we
anchor every decision in deterministic plans and Matklad-style testing.

Core themes:
- TigerStyle safety, performance, developer empathy.
- Cursor-led workflows with GrainVault keys for encrypted automation.
- Vegan Tiger aesthetic shaping Ghostty palettes and ASCII tone.
- GrainLoop + Graindaemon anchoring networking and supervision without
  libuv or sysv sprawl—TigerBeetle discipline in macOS Tahoe clothes.
