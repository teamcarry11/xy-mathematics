# Experiment 002 — GrainAurora Route Fuzz

- Objective: fuzz `src/grain_route.zig` to ensure npub/prefix matching is
  deterministic and bounded.
- Method: generate random npubs and compare match results against a
  reference implementation with string trimming.
- Notes: integrate into future Matklad loop once Aurora templates
  solidify.
