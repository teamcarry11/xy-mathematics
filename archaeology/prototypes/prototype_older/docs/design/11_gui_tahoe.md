# Grain Documentary Part 11 — Tahoe GUI Sandbox

This part surveys `src/tahoe_window.zig` and the GUI research log. We
describe how River’s tiling philosophy blends with Ghostty, how Moonglow
keybindings translate into Grain workflows, and how Nostr timelines will
appear inside Tahoe panes. Future work includes Metal rendering, sandbox
entitlements, and integrating TigerBank dashboards.
