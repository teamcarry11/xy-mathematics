## Mentoring for Systems Builders Who Think Differently

I'm 29, living in Northern Nevada. I've been self-studying for 7 years now. I left formal employment behind to live like a monk off modest savings and some lucky bets, so I could stay on the cutting edge of research that's evolved into this wild software technology extravaganza we're all living through right now.

Here's my story: I realized early on that the conventional path wasn't going to get me where I wanted to go. I wanted to understand how computers actually work, not just how to use the latest framework. So I took a risk. I saved up, made some bets that paid off, and decided to spend my time learning the things that actually mattered to me instead of climbing a corporate ladder.

It's been 7 years of building, breaking things, learning, failing, and occasionally getting something right. I'm building an operating system from scratch in Zig, a [relatively new programming language](https://ziglang.org) for sharp systems thinkers. I'm working on reinventing browsers and editors. I'm exploring ideas that might be completely wrong, but at least they're asking the right questions.

I'm not a senior engineer at Google. I'm not a professor. I'm someone who took a different path, and I've learned some things that might help you if you're also questioning the conventional wisdom.

If you're building with Zig instead of Python, thinking about RISC-V instead of x86, exploring Nostr instead of Ethereum, or wondering why everyone's still talking about JavaScript when we could be building browsers from scratch—you're probably not finding great answers in the top search results. I get it. I've been there.

## Who This Is For

Maybe you're a college dropout who realized the curriculum was teaching you Python while you wanted to understand how computers actually work. Maybe you're a high school student who's already building operating systems but your parents think you should focus on getting into a "good" internship at a FAANG company. Maybe you've been grinding through Discord servers and crypto-Telegram groups, drowning in noise, trying to find someone who actually knows what they're talking about.

Or maybe you're stuck between "just learn React" advice and your gut feeling that there's something fundamentally broken about how we build software. Or you're dealing with family who don't understand why you're not pursuing the conventional path, and you need help bridging that conversation.

I've been there. I'm still there, honestly. The difference is I've spent 7 years figuring out how to navigate this space without the traditional credentials, and I've made enough mistakes that I can help you avoid some of them.

## What You Get

You get access to a back-catalog of questions and answers about systems programming, RISC-V, Zig, operating systems, and building from first principles. Real conversations, not marketing copy. You get a private chat workspace where you can ask questions and get honest answers. No gatekeeping, no pretending I know everything.

You get Office Hours sessions by chat or video. Show up, ask questions, or just listen. Your call. You get direct access to me for sensitive questions. Sometimes you need to talk to someone who gets it.

You can book working sessions at a fraction of what companies pay. But only if you want to, and only after I've earned your trust. You get early access to events and programs, sometimes free, sometimes discounted. I'm building this as I go, and subscribers get first dibs.

Cancel anytime. No pressure. Stay as long as it's helping, leave when you've got what you need.

**USD 89 per month.**

## What I Can Actually Help With

Let me be honest about what I know and what I don't.

I haven't been writing Zig code for years, but the syntax is so easy, and the concepts are really clear. You can learn the basics in a weekend. I've been using it to build real systems, so I can share what I've figured out and help you think through problems I've already solved, or failed at, which is often more useful.

I'm building an OS from scratch, so I'm learning systems programming in real-time. RISC-V architecture, operating systems design, kernel development, virtual machines, JIT compilation. I can share what I've learned and help you think through problems I've already wrestled with.

I've been developing what I call "GrainStyle"—a coding discipline focused on explicit limits, bounded allocations, and code that teaches. It's not for everyone, but if you're tired of hidden allocations and implicit behavior, we can talk.

I'm interested in the grandiose, ambitious ideas that might be completely wrong but are at least asking the right questions. Building browsers from scratch. Reinventing editors. Nostr-native applications. TigerBeetle-style state machines. If you're also questioning the fundamentals, we should talk.

I'm learning about hardware and sustainability. RISC-V for AI workloads, spatial architectures, repairable hardware, green computing. I'm not an expert, but I'm learning, and I can help you think through the trade-offs.

I can help with the non-technical stuff too. How to explain to your parents why you're not going the conventional route. How to navigate family conversations about dropping out or taking a different path. How to build a portfolio when you're not following the standard playbook. I've had these conversations. I can help you have them too.

I'm running a monorepo with multiple projects, so I've made the mistakes and learned some lessons about organizing code, managing dependencies, and building sustainable projects.

I'm using AI assistants daily to build complex systems. GLM-4.6 integration, multi-AI synthesis, parallel agent coordination. I can help you leverage them effectively without losing code quality.

## What I'm Not

I'm not a life coach. I'm not a therapist. I'm not going to tell you to "follow your dreams" in a way that ignores reality. I'm also not going to tell you to "just get a job at Google" if that's not what you want.

I'm someone who took a risk, learned some things, and wants to help other people who are also taking risks, or thinking about it.

## The Family Conversation

Here's something I've learned: sometimes the hardest part of pursuing unconventional paths isn't the technical work. It's the conversations with parents, guardians, or family who don't understand why you're not following the script.

I offer unlicensed family communication services. That's a fancy way of saying I can help you have conversations with your family about why you're interested in systems programming, why conventional paths might not be right for you, and how to bridge the gap between their concerns and your ambitions.

This isn't therapy. It's practical help navigating conversations that can be really difficult when you're young and your family wants what's "best" for you but doesn't understand your specific interests.

## A Note About Ambition

Some of the ideas I'm interested in are grandiose. Building operating systems from scratch. Reinventing browsers. Questioning fundamental assumptions about how we compute. These might be completely wrong. They might be right but take 20 years to matter. They might be right and matter next year.

I'm aware of the speculative nature of these claims. I'm also aware that the mainstream advice—learn Python, get a job at a big tech company, contribute to open source in the "right" way—isn't always right for everyone.

If you're someone who's questioning the fundamentals, who's willing to take risks, who's okay with being wrong sometimes in service of being right about something important, we should talk.

## For Companies

I offer this to individuals, but companies can also hire me for consulting. If you're an individual in a larger organization and this sounds useful, join us. If it makes sense for your company to engage me more broadly later, we'll figure that out when we get there.
