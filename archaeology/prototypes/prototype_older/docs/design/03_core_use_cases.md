# Grain Documentary Part 3 — Core Use Cases

We tour three pillars of Grain deployments: community cooperatives,
vegan supply chains, and Tahoe research labs. Each scenario shows how
TigerBank MMT currencies, CDN bundle settlements, and Nostr relay feeds
combine. Contracts encode payments, Ghostty panes host Grain Conductor,
and Matklad tests guarantee deterministic behavior for every operator.

Spotlight:
- Cooperative treasury using VRF epoch rotation.
- Vegan retail proof-of-sales via optional ledger structs.
- Lab telemetry anchored to checkpoints for auditors.
