│        we write documentation not as afterthought,                      │
│        but as first principle. code explains how,                       │
│        comments explain why. together they form                         │

│        our style guide is not just rules, but                           │
│        philosophy. grain style teaches patience,                        │

│        bringing near-native performance to our                          │
