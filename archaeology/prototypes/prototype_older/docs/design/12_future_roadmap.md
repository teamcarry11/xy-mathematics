# Grain Documentary Part 12 — Future Roadmap

We close with a roadmap driven by TigerStyle imperatives. Upcoming
milestones include real TigerBank RPC integrations, Tahoe GUI pilots,
expanded Ghostty theming, and community documentation sprints. Each phase
maps to tasks in `docs/ray.md` and the unified Cursor TODO loop. The
series reminds us to archive snapshots (`prototype_old/`), rerun wrap, and
keep the recursion counter honest.
