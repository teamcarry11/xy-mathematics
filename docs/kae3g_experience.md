## Personal Mentoring for Systems Builders

You need help, but you can't justify the expense of a full-time coach. Maybe you're not yet sure about buying one-on-one coaching sessions. You're struggling to convince your employer to pay for the mentoring you need. You need more than what the world offers you for free, but your budget doesn't have room for enterprise-level consulting.

I would like to help you.

If you already know me and trust me, then this is by far the most cost-effective way to hire me to get the help you urgently need.

## Do any of these sound like you?

* I can scroll through Discord servers and crypto-Telegram groups, but I don't know whom to trust and most of what I read is just noise. I can't keep up with all the channels, and the signal-to-noise ratio is brutal.
* I can read books, but I already have a backlog of 50 books that I'll probably never get around to reading. I don't know which books will help me, so I don't know how to prioritize. And after I've read a great book that helps me, reading more in that topic area feels like it doesn't give me much more.
* I have about 200 ideas for things to try, but I can't decide where to start, I can't do them all at once, and I'm worried that I'm going to choose the wrong thing.
* I have this learning allowance from my employer, but I need to use it for something more impactful than yet more books or training courses. (Does your employer place special constraints on how you spend your learning allowance? Tell me about your constraints and we can probably work something out that satisfies your employer.)
* I can talk to people in Slack communities and I learn some things from them, but I don't feel comfortable just asking them outright for help. It feels like taking advantage of them.
* I can get help from my friends, but I worry that they generally won't tell me what I need to hear.
* I want to do most of the learning on my own, but I don't have the time or energy to just try everything to see what helps. I need some direction.

In the space between Do It All Yourself and intensive 1-on-1 coaching lies The kae3g Experience. It works like this:

* You subscribe only as long as you need help, one month at a time.
* You ask questions to guide the conversation towards the topics that matter most to you right now.
* You join Office Hours sessions either by chat or by video conference. Participate openly or just lurk, whatever you're in the mood for.
* You participate by chat when you want the feeling of "being there" and in a discussion forum when you prefer to think things through by writing.
* You purchase personal working sessions only if you need them and only once I've earned enough of your trust.

**USD 79 per month.**

## What You Get

* Access to a back-catalog of well over 200,000 words of questions and answers with topics about systems programming, RISC-V architecture, Zig development, operating systems design, and building from first principles.
* Access to a private chat workspace: ask questions, get answers, chat with the other members of the group.
* The chance to have interesting and helpful discussions with other members of the group.
* The "Bat Phone": rapid, direct access to me by email or private chat for especially sensitive questions.
* The option to purchase individual working sessions at more than 75% off the price that companies pay to hire me.
* Advance notice of special events and programs, such as group practice sessions and micro-training courses, and at discounted prices. Sometimes free.
* Cancel your subscription any time if you decide that you've got what you needed.

All subscriptions are monthly, so there's no pressure and no long-term commitment: stay as long as it's helping and leave when you've got what you needed.

> "We had one year of fruitful email conversations and I learned a lot from you and your courses. I think we accomplished a lot of the things we talked about in the beginning on how I can get better in systems programming and why I need to change my approach: I got a new perspective, I left my old patterns changed by your and my ideas and the situation is much better now. My colleagues are still motivated to someday break through the technical problems or work around them in a way, that the whole project benefits from it even more." — Anonymous

## What Kind of Help Can You Expect?

Here are some areas in which I have been helping people since the early 2020s:

* **Systems programming from first principles**: RISC-V architecture, operating systems design, kernel development, virtual machines, JIT compilation. Techniques for building systems that are correct, fast, and maintainable.
* **Zig development practices**: GrainStyle coding discipline, explicit limits, bounded allocations, assertion-driven development. Techniques for writing code that teaches and grows without breaking.
* **Reinventing computing paradigms**: Building browsers from scratch, editor design (Matklad-inspired), Nostr-native applications, TigerBeetle-style state machines. Techniques for questioning assumptions and building better foundations.
* **Hardware-aware software design**: RISC-V for AI workloads, spatial architectures (WSE), repairable hardware (Framework 13), green computing. Techniques for aligning software with hardware realities and sustainability goals.
* **Educational content creation**: Learning courses, documentation that teaches, code that explains itself. Techniques for preserving and sharing knowledge effectively.
* **Monorepo architecture**: Grain mirroring, chronological file naming (grainorder), temporal awareness (graintime). Techniques for organizing large codebases and knowledge repositories.
* **Agentic coding workflows**: GLM-4.6 integration, multi-AI synthesis, parallel agent coordination. Techniques for leveraging AI assistants effectively while maintaining code quality.
* **Open-source community building**: Organization management, repository structure, documentation standards. Techniques for building sustainable open-source projects.

## Not Only "Systems Programming"

I'm known in some circles for being "a RISC-V person", for teaching Zig, and for generally leaning towards "build from scratch" ways of working. Even so, I don't push any particular framework. I value explicit limits and assertions, I recognize the power of code that teaches, and I like to help people figure out when they need to question assumptions and when they need to build on solid foundations. No matter the topic, we spend most of our time talking about the nature of the problem, then potential solutions seem to present themselves to us.

## Not Only For Systems Programmers

Although systems programmers are still the largest group of software professionals who find me, we address issues that go far beyond writing kernel code, designing VMs, and building operating systems. I also help software professionals with other aspects of their work and indeed their lives away from their job.

* **Hardware selection and repairability**: Choosing the right hardware (Framework 13, RISC-V boards), understanding repairability trade-offs, building sustainable computing practices.
* **Open-source project management**: Organizing monorepos, managing dependencies, building community.
* **Educational content strategy**: Creating learning courses, writing documentation that teaches, structuring knowledge repositories.
* **Career navigation in systems programming**: Finding the right projects, building a portfolio, contributing to open-source.
* **Sustainable computing practices**: Green computing, e-waste reduction, conflict material sourcing, America First manufacturing.

I'm not a "life coach" and I'm definitely not a licensed therapist. I commit firmly to avoid stepping over that line. Even so, I do my best to create a space in which systems builders feel safe about asking for the help they need.

Often I start working with clients by discussing systems architecture techniques, but as we start addressing those issues, it becomes clear that we need to account for outside forces. This mostly means some combination of "hardware constraints" and "the stories I tell myself about what's possible". We start trying to build a kernel and we end up talking about the problem of choosing the right hardware target. We start trying to refactor code and we end up talking about the technical lead who refuses to write anything down. We start trying to write better tests and we end up talking about how hard it will be to justify this approach to their co-workers. I learned it from experience: every problem eventually becomes a "foundation problem". And remember that we are also part of the foundation, so we are often part of the problem.

## A Note To Companies

I offer this mentoring service to individuals, but companies also hire me for this style of incremental consulting at a distance. If you're bigger than a "one-person show", then please read more about how to book a working session with me. This service is not suitable for me to mentor a team nor to do roving consulting for various teams within a larger organization. If you need a more comprehensive program than merely the occasional working session, then read more about my consulting services.

If you're an individual working in a larger organization, then please join us. If, over time, you decided that it would benefit the organization to engage me, then we would know enough by then to start designing a coaching program that fits your wider community.
