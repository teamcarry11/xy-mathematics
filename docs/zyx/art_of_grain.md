# The Art of Grain: Writing Code That Lasts

> "Code is written once, read many times. Write it to teach."

## The Philosophy

We are building a movement away from "move fast and break things" toward **"patient discipline."**

The Art of Grain is about:
1.  **Sustainability**: Code that grows like grain, feeding the future.
2.  **Constraints**: Finding freedom in the 75x100 grid.
3.  **Teaching**: Every line of code is a lesson for the next developer.

## The Course (Draft Outline)

### Part I: The Soil (Mindset)
- Why we chose Zig (explicitness as a virtue).
- The "Mad Scientist" archetype: creativity within rigor.
- The 75-character limit: why hard wrapping matters.

### Part II: The Seed (Technique)
- **Grain Style**: The official style guide.
- **Graincards**: Portable, printable, beautiful code units.
- **Grainmirror**: Managing dependencies without chaos.

### Part III: The Harvest (Value)
- Building systems that survive 10+ years.
- The economics of maintainability.
- How to sell "Grain Audits" to enterprise.

## Monetization Strategy

1.  **The Book**: A premium, printed edition of "The Art of Grain" (formatted as a series of Graincards).
2.  **Sponsorships**: Patrons who support the development of `xy-mathematics` and the Glow G2 voice.
3.  **Consulting**: Helping teams migrate to Zig with Grain Style discipline.
