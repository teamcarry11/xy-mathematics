# WSE National Strategy: Modern Monetary Theory and Open Hardware Policy

**Vision**: Address WSE limitations through U.S. national policy, MMT-based direct fiat injection, and open hardware design inspired by Cerebras.

**Date**: 2025-11-21  
**Status**: Strategic policy analysis for WSE adoption at national scale

## Executive Summary

The Cerebras WSE (Wafer-Scale Engine) approach offers revolutionary performance and environmental benefits, but faces three critical limitations:

1. **SRAM Capacity**: 44GB on-wafer SRAM limits hot cache size
2. **Wafer Cost**: High initial cost for WSE wafer
3. **Specialized Hardware**: Requires WSE-specific hardware, not commodity servers

**Solution**: Strategic U.S. government intervention using Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) principles to directly fund open hardware WSE development, addressing all three limitations while advancing national interests in green computing, supply chain security, and technological leadership.

## Part 1: WSE Limitations and National Interest

### The Three Limitations

#### 1. SRAM Capacity: 44GB On-Wafer SRAM

**Technical Constraint**:
- 44GB on-wafer SRAM limits hot cache size
- For large datasets, requires frequent object storage access
- Reduces performance advantage for cold data queries

**National Interest Impact**:
- **Green Computing**: RAM-only execution reduces e-waste, power consumption
- **Supply Chain Security**: SRAM uses U.S. supply chains (no conflict materials)
- **Technological Leadership**: WSE represents cutting-edge spatial computing

**Strategic Value**: High - Enables RAM-only cloud computing, reduces dependency on conflict materials

#### 2. Wafer Cost: High Initial Investment

**Economic Constraint**:
- WSE wafer is expensive (specialized hardware, low volume)
- High initial cost barriers entry for startups, research institutions
- Limits adoption to well-funded organizations

**National Interest Impact**:
- **Economic Competitiveness**: High costs limit U.S. innovation in AI, scientific computing
- **Research Leadership**: Universities, national labs cannot afford WSE hardware
- **Startup Ecosystem**: High barriers prevent U.S. startups from competing globally

**Strategic Value**: Critical - Cost barriers prevent U.S. from leading in spatial computing

#### 3. Specialized Hardware: Not Commodity Servers

**Infrastructure Constraint**:
- Requires WSE-specific hardware, not commodity servers
- Vendor lock-in to Cerebras (proprietary technology)
- Limits flexibility, repairability, open hardware principles

**National Interest Impact**:
- **Vendor Lock-In**: Dependency on single vendor creates supply chain risk
- **Open Hardware**: Proprietary design prevents open innovation, repairability
- **National Security**: Closed hardware limits auditability, verification

**Strategic Value**: Critical - Open hardware design essential for national security, innovation

### Why This Matters for U.S. National Interest

**1. Green Computing Leadership**:
- WSE enables RAM-only cloud computing (5-10× less e-waste, 100-1000× energy reduction)
- Aligns with U.S. climate goals (net-zero emissions, green infrastructure)
- Reduces dependency on conflict materials (cobalt, tantalum, rare earth elements)

**2. Supply Chain Security**:
- SRAM uses U.S. supply chains (Silicon, copper, aluminum from domestic sources)
- Eliminates dependency on China for rare earth elements
- Reduces geopolitical risk in critical computing infrastructure

**3. Technological Leadership**:
- WSE represents next-generation spatial computing (not von Neumann)
- U.S. leadership in WSE = leadership in AI, scientific computing, green tech
- Prevents technological dependency on foreign competitors

**4. Economic Competitiveness**:
- WSE enables 100-2000× performance improvements for AI, scientific computing
- U.S. companies with WSE access = competitive advantage globally
- Creates high-skill jobs in design, manufacturing, software

**5. National Security**:
- Open hardware design enables auditability, verification
- Reduces supply chain risk (no single vendor dependency)
- Enables secure, verifiable computing infrastructure

## Part 2: Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) Framework

### MMT Principles (Professor L. Randall Wray)

**Core Tenets**:
1. **Sovereign Currency**: U.S. can create unlimited fiat currency (dollar is not resource-constrained)
2. **Real Resource Constraints**: Only real resources (labor, materials, technology) are limiting
3. **Full Employment**: Government spending should target full employment, not balanced budgets
4. **Inflation Management**: Inflation, not debt, is the real constraint on government spending
5. **Public Purpose**: Government spending should serve public purpose (infrastructure, R&D, green tech)

**Key Insight**: For a currency-issuing government like the U.S., the question is not "can we afford it?" but "do we have the real resources to build it?"

### MMT Applied to WSE Development

**The WSE Challenge**:
- **Real Resources Available**: U.S. has fabs (CHIPS Act), engineers, materials (domestic supply chains)
- **Currency Constraint**: None - U.S. can create dollars to fund WSE development
- **Inflation Risk**: Minimal - WSE development creates productive capacity, reduces long-term costs

**MMT Solution**: Direct fiat injection into WSE supply chain via government spending

**Why MMT Works for WSE**:
1. **Public Purpose**: WSE serves national interest (green computing, supply chain security, tech leadership)
2. **Real Resources**: U.S. has capacity (fabs, engineers, materials)
3. **Inflation Management**: WSE reduces long-term costs (energy, e-waste), creates productive capacity
4. **Full Employment**: WSE development creates high-skill jobs (design, manufacturing, software)

- **Real Resources**: 
  - **Labor**: Engineers, designers, manufacturers (U.S. has capacity)
  - **Materials**: Silicon, copper, aluminum (U.S. has domestic sources)
  - **Technology**: Fabs, design tools (U.S. has CHIPS Act fabs)

**Outcome**: Open hardware WSE inspired by Cerebras, but fully open-source, government-funded, widely accessible, serving U.S. national interests in green computing, supply chain security, and technological leadership.

**The Path Forward**: Expand CHIPS Act to include WSE open hardware development, leveraging existing semiconductor manufacturing policy and bipartisan support for national security and green computing.
