Hello. I'm Keaton Dunsford, and I'm building Grain OS—a minimal, safety-first operating system written in Zig, targeting RISC-V hardware with a clear path toward repairable, sustainable computing.

This project is a long climb. We're building from the ground up: a RISC-V kernel, a JIT-compiled VM, a native macOS IDE, and eventually, custom hardware. It's ambitious work, and I'm doing it because I believe in systems that last—code that teaches, hardware that repairs, infrastructure that grows sustainably.

If you're here, you probably share some of that vision. Maybe you're curious about RISC-V, or Zig, or the idea of building an OS from scratch. Maybe you've hit a wall in your own work and need to talk it through. Maybe you just want to say hello.

I'd like to hear from you.

Write something complete and human, and I should hopefully respond.

*Building Grain OS takes time. Building community takes longer. But both are worth the effort. Let's talk.*
